## About

A bit about me. I am a retail professional looking to make a career shift into tech. I've alwayed loved video games and discovered my passion for all things tech back in 2006 with ```Gary's Mod```. Endless hours were poured into that and other games like ```Counter Strike Source```, ```World of Warcraft```, and ```Runescape``` - to name very few.

Coding progressive and responsive web applications has become my newest passion and I'm excited to see where this path leads me.

Don't hesitate to reach out through the links [Here](#contributors) or in the live deployment of my portfolio. Let's talk tech, books, games, music, or anything else!
